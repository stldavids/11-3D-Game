A Simple 3D game.  Player is a hole, meant to capture all objects in the level.  Controls are WASD, ESC to quit, and UP/DOWN to increase/decrease the size of the hole.  All objects have points.  There is a timer, and if it runs out before the player has all the objects, the player will be sent to a game over screen.  If player can capture all the objects, they will be sent to a win screen.  

A known bug is that sometimes objects won't fall into the hole correctly.  An in-game work around is to just keep trying until it does work.
